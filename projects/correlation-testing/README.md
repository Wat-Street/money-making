# Correlation Testing

**Project Overview**  
Correlation Testing is a research and development initiative aimed at analyzing the relationship between two securities. The project investigates how correlated price movements evolve over time, with a focus on time dilation—the lag or lead between stock movements—to uncover patterns that can inform statistical arbitrage strategies.

**Key Components**  
- **Time-Dilated Correlation Analysis**  
  Analyze how the correlation between two stock price series changes when one is shifted in time. This helps identify lead-lag relationships where one asset consistently moves before the other.

- **Interactive Visualization**  
  Develop graphs to visualize correlation values across different time dilations (e.g., from -10 days to +10 days) to find peak correlation points.

- **Research Replication**  
  Select and reproduce correlation techniques from established academic or industry papers to benchmark and validate our approach.

- **Eventual Integration with Wat Street Ecosystem**

**Purpose and Application**  
- **Foundation for Statistical Arbitrage**  
  Results from this project will inform strategies like **pairs trading**, where two historically correlated stocks are traded based on deviations from their typical relationship.

- **Portfolio Construction and Risk Management**  
  Correlation insights help with portfolio diversification by identifying co-moving assets and quantifying exposure to systemic risk.
